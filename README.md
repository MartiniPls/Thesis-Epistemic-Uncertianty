# EXPLORING THE EFFECTS OF ADVERSARIAL DATA AND MODEL ROBUSTNESS ON QUANTIFYING EPISTEMIC UNCERTAINTY FOR CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
This repo contains my Thesis' Code and Experiments implemented in PyTorch. 
<br>
The thesis used the epistemic uncertianty quantifications from http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01768.
